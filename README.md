📊 Bank Marketing Strategy & Funnel Analysis
Data Science Internship Task - Future Interns

🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset to understand customer behavior and optimize the conversion funnel for term deposit subscriptions. By identifying key drop-off points and high-converting segments, we provide actionable insights for the marketing team.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: * Pandas (Data Manipulation)

Plotly Express (Interactive Visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)


📈 Key Analysis & Insights
1. The Conversion Funnel
I built a 3-stage funnel to track the customer journey:

Stage 1: Total Contacts (Initial reach out)

Stage 2: Interested Leads (Filtered by call duration > 120 seconds)

Stage 3: Successful Subscriptions (Final conversion)

Result: The overall campaign achieved a 11.70% conversion rate.

2. Behavioral Drivers (Duration)
Insight: There is a direct correlation between call duration and success. Customers who subscribed spent significantly more time on the call compared to those who refused.

3. Demographic Targeting (Job & Education)
Insight: Management, Technicians, and Retired individuals showed the highest interest. Targeting these specific segments can reduce marketing costs and improve ROI.

💡 Recommendation for the Bank
Optimize the First 30 Seconds: The highest drop-off happens at the start. Training agents on better opening pitches is crucial.

Focus on Re-engagement: Focus efforts on "Retired" and "Student" segments as they show higher conversion potential relative to their volume.
